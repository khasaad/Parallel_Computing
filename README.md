# Parallel_Computing

It contains two projects.
The first: Project_Parallel_Computing_2017-2018: "The goal of this project is to implement a parallel code in Fortran 90 to solve numerically the equation of heat in 2D.
For this, we first established an implicit numerical scheme for finite di ff erences in matrix form, which led to the resolution of a linear system. We then looked for the properties of the square matrix of the linear system in order to choose a suitable linear solver.
Finally, the digital resolution was implemented sequentially at first, and in a second step the code was parallelized using the MPI library."

The second: Project_Parallel_Computing_2018-2019: " "
